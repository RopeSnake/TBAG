oc = obj_cursor <br>
ot = obj_text_symbols <br>
op = obj_player <br>
mk.gml = scr_modifier_keys() <br>
lr.gml = scr_load_resources() <br>
td.gml = scr_text_destroy() <br>
tc.gml = scr_text_recreate() <br><br>

Inside an objects' folder, you'll see a few files<br>
these are the events of the object<br>
The first letter is always the second character in the objects name<br>
So if the objects name is oc, then the create event in that object will be cc.gml<br>
Same for the step event and draw event<br>
